# TESTING YOUR CUSTOM FIORI LAUNCHPAD PLUGIN

## Introduction
In this section you will find the steps to test your custom Launchpad plugin.

## Test your plugin
You should start by creating a new ABAP project for your SAP S/4HANA 2022 system. To do this follow the next steps:

101. Open your Fiori Launchpad by running transaction **/n/ui2/flp** from GUI/WebGUI or by navigating directly to the Fiori Launchpad URL (for example: **https://< Your system FQDN >:< Your system port >/sap/bc/ui2/flp**).

  As the launchpad loads, you will find the text in the SAP Fiori Launchpad Header title.

# CREATING AN HTTP SERVICE

## Introduction
In this section you will find the steps to create an HTTP Service in Embedded Steampunk which you cal later call from your browser

## Create a custom HTTP Service in Embedded Steampunk
To create this custom HTTP Service, you would need to work in the Embedded Steampunk development package you created earlier as part of [Exercise 1](../ex_1#create-a-custom-development-package-for-your-embedded-steampunk-custom-developments).

42. In **Project Explorer**, right-click on the ABAP Package **"ZCUSTOM_OBJECTS4STMPNK"**. From the menu, select **New >> Other ABAP Repository Object**.

  ![Step42](images/step42.png)

43. In the dialog window, search for keyword: "Service". Once results are displayed, select entry **HTTP Service** and click **Next**.

  ![Step43](images/step43.png)

44. Enter the following information and click **Next**:
  * Name: **<< Your custom HTTP service name >>** (for example: ZGET_SYSTEM_DETAILS).
  * Description: **<< Your custom HTTP service  description >>** (for example: GET Backend System Details).
  * Add to favorite packages: **Inactive**

  **NOTE** - The value in parameter **Handler Class** will be updated automatically, do not modify this value.

  ![Step44](images/step44.png)

45. Select an existing transport request or create a new one to save your changes and click **Finish**

  ![Step19](images/step19.png)

46. On successful creation you will notice two objects have been generated: an HTTP service and a Handler Class. Navigate to the Handler Class by clicking on text "Handler Class".

  ![Step46](images/step46.png)

47. Copy the code from our [sample](sources/ZCL_GET_SYSTEM_DETAILS.abap) into this handler class. **Save** and **Activate**.

  ![Step47](images/step47.png)

48. When trying to activate a critical error will be displayed which would not allow you to activate this object.

  ![Step48](images/step48.png)

  **NOTE** - The error is generated because the most important step to consume the backend wrapper is missing. In the next section you will find how to add a Release Contract to the backend wrapper function module. Be aware that when coding in Embedded Steampunk, you may only consume "cloud-released" objects.

## Adding a Release Contact
As mentioned above, when coding in Embedded Steampunk, you may only consume "cloud-released" objects. In this section we will explain how to add a Release Contract to our wrapper function module.

49. Using **PRoject Explorer**, navigate to and open Function Module "Z_GET_SYSTEM_DETAILS". Once the function module is displayed, go to **Properties** view in ADT

  ![Step49](images/step49.png)

  **NOTE** - If you cannot find the **Properties** view, navigate to **Window >> Show View >> Properties**.

  ![Step49trbl](images/step49trbl.png)

50. In **Properties** view, switch to **API State** tab and click on **Add Release Contract**

  ![Step50](images/step50.png)

51. In the dialog screen, use the default provided values and click on **Next**
  * Release State: **Released**
  * Visibility: **Use in Cloud Development**

  ![Step51](images/step51.png)

52. No conflicts should be identified, click on **Next**.

  ![Step52](images/step52.png)

53. Select an existing transport request or create a new one to save your changes and click **Finish**

  ![Step19](images/step19.png)

54. Once successfully saved, you should notice Release Contract **C1** has been assigned to function module "Z_GET_SYSTEM_DETAILS".

  ![Step54](images/step54.png)

55. Go back to handler class "ZCL_GET_SYSTEM_DETAILS" and **Activate**, activation should be successful.

  ![Step55](images/step55.png)

56. Open SAP GUI transaction **/nUCON_HTTP_SERVICES**.

  ![Step56](images/step56.png)

57. Click on Search button and scroll to your service (ZGET_SYSTEM_DETAILS).

  ![Step57](images/step57.png)

58. Select your service (ZGET_SYSTEM_DETAILS) and click on **Activate**

  ![Step58](images/step58.png)

  **NOTE** - These last steps are required to activate your custom HTTP service as simply activating the code is not enough for activating an HTTP service.

## What does this code do?
In this section we will briefly explain what the copied code is doing.

  ![Step59](images/step59.png)

59.1 In this part of the code we are calling the "cloud-enabled" function module **Z_GET_SYSTEM_DETAILS**

59.2 In this section we are concatenating the values of System Id, Client and some additional texts into a single string which will be shown as the output from this service call.

59.3 In this section we return the concatenated string as the body of the HTML response.

## Test the code
In this section we will briefly explain how to test the code.

60. To test the code, click on the **URL** text. The service will be opened in your desktop's browser and you should see the string containing text with System ID and Client number

  **NOTE** - You will be prompted for authentication (basic or SAML depending on your system settings).

  ![Step60](images/step60.png)

  **NOTE** - To debug your code, you can add breakpoints anywhere in your handler class (ZCL_GET_SYSTEM_DETAILS)

  ![Step60dbg](images/step60dbg.png)

## Next Steps
In the next section you will create the second object in our custom development architecture: **a Custom Fiori Launchpad Service (number 3 in the diagram)**.

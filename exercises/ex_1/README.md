# SETTING UP EMBEDDED STEAMPUNK

## Introduction
In this section you will find the required steps to run the basic setup of Embedded Steampunk. This step is mandatory for you to run the exercise end-to-end.

## Create a new ABAP Project in ADT (Eclipse)
You should start by creating a new ABAP project for your SAP S/4HANA 2022 system. To do this follow the next steps:

1. Create a new project in ADT.

  ![New Project](images/new_project.png)

2. Select the backend system you will connect to and click **Next**.

  ![Select System](images/select_system.png)

3. Confirm system connection parameters (or edit as needed) and click **Next**.

  **NOTE - In this screen you may also create a new connection from scratch.**

4. Enter your system Id to setup a connection to the backend system and click **Next**

5. Setup a friendly name for your ABAP project (for example: <SID>_Demo_FLPplugin) and click **Finish**.

6. Once all steps are run you will find your new project in the **Project Explorer** section in ADT.

## Create a custom software component
Using developer extensibility requires a separate software component if you want to use it in parallel to classic extensibility.

To create this custom software component follow the next steps:

7. Highlight your recently created project in the **Project Explorer** section in ADT and click on button **Open SAP GUI**

  ![Step7](images/step7.png)

8. In the pop-up dialog, confirm project selection is correct and click **Ok**.

  ![Step8](images/step8.png)

9. ADT should now display a classic SAP GUI screen

  ![Step9](images/step9.png)

10. In this GUI screen run transaction **SE38**

  ![Step10](images/step10.png)

11. Run program **RSMAINTAIN_SWCOMPONENTS**.

  ![Step11](images/step11.png)

12. Click on the **Add** button.

  ![Step12](images/step12.png)

13. In the dialog screen enter the following details and **Save**:

  * Component: **<< Your component name >>** (for example: ZEMBEDDED_STEAMPUNK)
  * Release: **DEV**
  * Development type: **Transportable**
  * ABAP Language version: **ABAP for Cloud**
  * Component type: **K**
  * Description: **<< Your component description >>** (for example: Custom Component for Steampunk Development)

  ![Step13](images/step13.png)

14. To save your component to a transport request start by selecting your new component followed by clicking on the **Transport Software Component Entry**, you will be prompted for a workbench request (enter details as needed and save).

  ![Step14](images/step14.png)

15. Once your software component is saved to a transport request, you need to release such transport request before continuing with the next steps. To release your transport, navigate to the **Transport Organizer** tab in ADT, right click on your transport task and release.

  ![Step15](images/step15.png)

  **NOTE** - If you cannot find **Transport Organizer** navigate to: **Window >> Show View >> Others**. Search for transport in search help and once you find the view click **Open**.

## Create a custom structure package
All your custom development packages would need to be located below a structure package that is specified to use ABAP language version ABAP for Cloud Development, this way the system differentiates objects created through classic extensibility or through developer extensibility (Embedded Steampunk).

To create this custom structure package follow the next steps:

16. In the **Project Explorer**, right-click on the ABAP Project for your development system and from the menu, select **New >> ABAP Package**.

  ![Step16](images/step16.png)

17. Enter the following information and click **Next**:
  * Name: **<< Your component name >>** (this should be the same name you defined in Step 13 - for example: ZEMBEDDED_STEAMPUNK).
  * Description: **<< Your structure description >>** (for example: Embedded Steampunk Cloud-like developments).
  * Add to favorite packages: **Active**
  * Package Type: **Structure**

  ![Step17](images/step17.png)

18. Enter the software component where this objects will be allocated and click **Next**.
  * Software Component: **<< Your component name >>** (this should be the same name you defined in Step 13 - for example: ZEMBEDDED_STEAMPUNK).

  ![Step18](images/step18.png)

19. Select an existing transport request or create a new one to save your changes and click **Finish**

  ![Step19](images/step19.png)

20. Once created, package details will be displayed in the screen.

  **NOTE** - Notice that ABAP Language Version has already been defined, this means that all underlying packages in this structure will inherit this parameter.

  ![Step20](images/step20.png)

## Create a custom development package for your Embedded Steampunk custom developments
You have now setup the basics of Embedded Steampunk, however, you still need a main package to store all your custom developments. To do this, follow the next steps:

21. In **Project Explorer**, expand **Favorite Packages** and right-click on your recently created package structure. From the menu select **New >> ABAP Package**

  ![Step21](images/step21.png)

22. Enter the following information and click **Next**:
  * Name: **<< Your package name >>** (for example: ZCUSTOM_OBJECTS4STMPNK).
  * Description: **<< Your package description >>** (for example: Custom Objects for Embedded Steampunk).
  * Add to favorite packages: **Inactive**
  * Superpackage: **<< Your package structure name >>** (this should be the same name you defined in Step 17 - for example: ZEMBEDDED_STEAMPUNK).
  * Package Type: **Development**

  ![Step22](images/step22.png)

23. Select an existing transport request or create a new one to save your changes and click **Finish**

  ![Step19](images/step19.png)

24. Once created, package details will be displayed in the screen.

  **NOTE** - Try expanding the structure hierarchy in **Project Explorer** as your recently created package will be used in the following sections, additionally, you should notice that the ABAP Language version has already been setup for your development package. This setting will restrict your ABAP code to only consume cloud-released objects.

  ![Step24](images/step24.png)

## Next Steps
In the next section you will create the first object in our custom development architecture: **a Custom Function Module (number 1 in the diagram)**.
